This repository contains the Neural Language model implementation both at character Level and Word level.
The word_final.py file corresponds to the word level language model and will train a neural language model with 50 epochs on the gutenberg corpus . The perplexity measures will be the output of the script after model training and model would be saved in a file name LM.h5
The character_final.py file corresponds to the character level language model and will train a neural language model with 50 epochs on the gutenberg corpus . The perplexity measures will be the output of the script after model training.
A third script name sentence_final.py outputs a random sentence generated with the trained word level model. A trained model is also uploaded so that this file will output the random sentence without running above scripts.
A report in pdf format of this task has also been uploaded.
